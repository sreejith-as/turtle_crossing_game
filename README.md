A fun arcade-style game where a turtle tries to cross the road while avoiding speeding cars!

## Features

- **Score tracking:** Display the current level on the screen.  

## How to Play  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/sreejith-as/turtle-crossing-game.git  
   cd turtle-crossing-game  
   ```  
2. Run the script using Python:  
   ```bash  
   python turtle_crossing_game.py  
   ```  
3. Controls:  
   - Move the turtle forward: `Up Arrow`
   - Move the turtle backward: `Down Arrow`

4. Objective:  
   - Reach the top of the screen without getting hit by the cars.

## Key Learnings  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Created classes for the turtle, cars, and game mechanics.  
- **Collision Detection:** Handled collisions between the turtle and cars using distance-based calculations.  
- **Randomization:** Used the `random` module to vary car spawn positions and speeds.  
- **Game Loop:** Built an interactive game loop with increasing difficulty.
